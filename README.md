About
-------------
A fun iOS application I made as an exercise to create a nice UI similar to the App-Store all pragmatically without any addition libraries except UIKit. The app displays the featured feed from the iTunes store as well as the top 100 of AudioBooks, Songs, and iTunes U collections. Tapping on an audio object allows you to play the sample song, and taping on a collection displays the summary of the series. This application reads from iTunes RSS feed.
